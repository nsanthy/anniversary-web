      <h2>a letter to Anno 💌</h2>
      <p>
        A little surprise gift for you, to celebrate our first anniversary. Hopefully, the first of many more to come.
        <br><br>
        Knowing you and spending time with you has been one of the greatest joys of my life. You inspire me to grow into a better version of myself (I mean, I even dared to make this because of you 😊).
        <br><br>
        I am thankful for you.<br><br>
	You’re kind, smart, funny, and handsome. I wish you could see yourself the way I see you—then you’d understand how truly charming you are. And if others can’t see that, that’s their loss. I know I’m the lucky one, because I have you.<br><br>
        I am thankful for us.<br><br>
        Our relationship hasn’t been perfect — but I’ve come to realize that perfection doesn’t exist. And honestly, I love that. I love that we’re imperfect, that we sometimes argue, that we sometimes stumble. Because those moments, too, are part of our journey. They’ve helped us learn, helped us grow — not just as a couple, but as two people walking this path together.
        <br><br>
        What I want you to know is this: even through the rough patches, I love you. And if I were given the chance to relive my life and choose again, I would still choose you, every single time.
        <br><br>
        Always.<br><br>
        I love you.<br><br>
        xx
